## Requirements
It is recommended to run this project on a GPU.

Before running the project, ensure you have the following packages installed:
PlantTraitPrediction.ipynb has a cell which installs the packages for you

- Python 3.7 or later
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/fabric/stable/installation.html)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html)
- [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/)
- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) (standard library)
- [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) (standard library)

# Steps to Run the Project

**PlantTraitPrediction.ipynb** contains all the necessary scripts to run the project.

**Note:** 
You will need to download a `kaggle.json` file and upload it when prompted.
This is necessary to download the training data from kaggle.

As an alternative, you can also paste in a folder called 'data' which contains all the data needed for the project.

## Instructions

1. **Upload `kaggle.json`** when prompted in the Jupyter file.
2. **Run scripts** to download data from Kaggle.
3. **Run the rest of the cells** to perform the regression task.

## Expected Runtimes (Assuming this is run on a L4 GPU)

- **Generating DINO Embeddings:** 8 minutes
- **Training Autogluon Models:** 30-40 minutes (400 seconds limit set per trait)

## Hardware Information

The following code was developed and tested on Vertex AI provided by the Google Cloud Platform.

- **GPU Type:** NVIDIA L4
- **Machine Type:** g2-standard-8 (8 vCPU, 4 core, 32 GB Memory)


## Note

Testing with high limit on Autogluon produces better results. My top result on kaggle was produced after 5 hours of total runtime!
The limit is set to 400 in this notebook to produce a similar result (â‰ˆ 0.46) with a more bearable runtime.
